# docker-omsa

Dell OpenManage Server Administrator in Docker.

This is loosely based on https://hub.docker.com/r/jdelaros1/openmanage/ but updated for a newer version of OMSA. (20.02)

Currently this is a bit icky because it runs systemd within the container to get openmanage to start, but it does the job for now.

No SNMP support, maybe later.
